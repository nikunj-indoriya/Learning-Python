# Learning-Python

Welcome to the Learning-Python repository! This is where I document my journey through the "Complete Python Bootcamp" by Jose Portilla, sharing the simple yet meaningful projects I've completed along the way. This repository serves as a testament to my learning and growth in Python programming.

## Included Projects :

1. **Tic Tac Toe Game** 
2. **Black Jack Game**
3. **Card Game War**
4. **Bank Account**

## Purpose :

This repository serves as a central hub for my Python learning journey, providing a structured overview of the projects I've completed and the skills I've acquired. Whether you're a fellow learner seeking inspiration, a potential employer interested in my coding proficiency, or a collaborator looking to contribute or provide feedback, this repository welcomes you to explore, engage, and learn together.

Feel free to delve into the code, offer suggestions for improvement, or share your own experiences. Thank you for joining me on this exciting adventure of Learning-Python! Happy coding!
